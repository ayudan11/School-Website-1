                <h5 class="text-success text-justify"></h5>The DAV Mission of education is in tandem with the National Policy of Education which lays great emphasis on developing a national system of education, with education for all, keeping in mind the elimination of disparities in the education system and provision of more facilities through qualitative intervention, empowerment of women, access to education to disadvantaged sections of the society, educationally backward minorities and the disabled. It also calls for greater rigour and discipline in academic pursuits, autonomy and accountability, experimentation and innovation and nurturing excellence and modernization of processes at different levels of education. In order to accomplish the mission, the objectives laid down are as under:

To provide a holistic education by homogenizing the western knowledge while remaining anchored to the Indian cultural moorings;
• To act as a catalyst of change by spreading education, and by dismantling the cobwebs of ignorance and illiteracy;
• To develop individuals who are morally upright, intellectually well-informed, socially concerned, emotionally balanced, physically well-developed and culturally accomplished;
• To stimulate a scientific temper by crusading against superstitions and out-dated customs like child marriage, caste system, female foeticide, dowry, gender bias, regionalism etc;
• To sensitize individuals towards social welfare and
• To nurture creative and resourceful minds who think big, think fast and think ahead, who care for the nation and the weaker sections of society, and are imbued with humanistic passions and values.
